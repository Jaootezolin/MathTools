# MathTools

A multi-purpose math application built with Python and Tkinter.  
It includes several useful calculation modules and a simple graphical interface.

### Features
• Parabola calculator (from a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c, plots points in the Cartesian plane)  
• Pythagorean theorem calculator  
• Quadratic formula (Bhaskara) solver  
• Linear function evaluation (y = mx + b)  
• Basic trigonometry (sine, cosine and tangent from an angle)  
• Simple Mega-Sena number generator (random lottery simulation)

### Technologies Used
• Python  
• Tkinter (GUI)  
• Math module (for calculations)  
• Random module (for lottery simulation)

### Purpose
This project was created to practice:
- Graphical user interface development
- Code structuring and modularization
- Logic and mathematical functions in programming
